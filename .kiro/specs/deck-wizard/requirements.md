# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a comprehensive deck creation wizard system for a Reddit-based debate game application. The CreateDeckWizard component provides an intuitive, multi-step interface for content creators to build interactive question decks with support for multiple question types, drag-and-drop sequencing, and comprehensive validation. The system is being submitted to the Kiro hackathon and represents a fully functional implementation that demonstrates advanced React UI patterns, form validation, and user experience design.
