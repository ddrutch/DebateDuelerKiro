# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a dynamic live background system for a Reddit-based debate game application. The system is being submitted to the Kiro hackathon and represents a fully functional implementation that demonstrates advanced React animation techniques, real-time visual feedback, and emotional state representation. The project showcases how visual elements can enhance user engagement in gaming applications through dynamic, context-aware animations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Emotional Tier System

**User Story:** As a player, I want the background to visually represent my emotional state during gameplay, so that I can feel more immersed in the game experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game state changes THEN the system SHALL determine the appropriate emotional tier based on percentage score and contrarian mode
2. WHEN no card is selected THEN the system SHALL default to a neutral emotional tier
3. WHEN the emotional tier changes THEN the system SHALL update the background colors and emoticon sets accordingly
4. IF the tier data is invalid THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle errors and maintain visual consistency
5. WHEN switching between contrarian and conformist modes THEN the system SHALL adjust tier selection logic appropriately

### Requirement 2: Dynamic Emoticon Animation System

**User Story:** As a player, I want to see animated emoticons that react to my game progress, so that the interface feels alive and responsive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a tier becomes active THEN the system SHALL initialize a set of emoticon instances with random positions and velocities
2. WHEN emoticons move off-screen THEN the system SHALL respawn them at the bottom with new properties
3. WHEN the animation loop runs THEN the system SHALL update positions based on velocity and time delta
4. IF the component is inactive THEN the system SHALL pause all animations and hide visual elements
5. WHEN container dimensions change THEN the system SHALL adapt emoticon positioning and respawn logic

### Requirement 3: Morphing Animation Effects

**User Story:** As a player, I want emoticons to transform smoothly when my game state changes, so that transitions feel natural and engaging.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the emotional tier changes THEN the system SHALL select a portion of emoticons to morph to new expressions
2. WHEN morphing occurs THEN the system SHALL animate the transition over a configurable duration
3. WHEN morphing completes THEN the system SHALL update to the target emoticon and reset morphing state
4. IF multiple morphs are triggered THEN the system SHALL handle overlapping animations gracefully
5. WHEN morphing THEN the system SHALL apply scaling effects to emphasize the transformation

### Requirement 4: Particle Burst Effects

**User Story:** As a player, I want dramatic visual effects when I make strong choices, so that impactful moments are highlighted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a strong reaction is detected THEN the system SHALL create additional emoticon instances as burst effects
2. WHEN burst emoticons are created THEN the system SHALL position them near the center of the screen
3. WHEN burst emoticons animate THEN the system SHALL use higher velocities and different scaling
4. IF burst effects overlap THEN the system SHALL manage opacity and layering appropriately
5. WHEN burst effects complete THEN the system SHALL fade them out naturally

### Requirement 5: Glow and Lighting Effects

**User Story:** As a player, I want atmospheric lighting that matches my emotional state, so that the visual theme reinforces the game mood.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the emotional tier changes THEN the system SHALL update the glow color to match the tier
2. WHEN glow opacity changes THEN the system SHALL animate the transition smoothly
3. WHEN extreme scores occur THEN the system SHALL increase glow intensity proportionally
4. IF a custom glow color is provided THEN the system SHALL override the tier-based color
5. WHEN the component is inactive THEN the system SHALL fade out the glow effect

### Requirement 6: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a player, I want smooth animations without performance issues, so that the game remains responsive on various devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the animation loop runs THEN the system SHALL limit updates to 60fps using requestAnimationFrame
2. WHEN calculating positions THEN the system SHALL use efficient mathematical operations
3. WHEN rendering emoticons THEN the system SHALL use CSS transforms for hardware acceleration
4. IF the component unmounts THEN the system SHALL properly cancel animation frames
5. WHEN many emoticons are active THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent frame rates

### Requirement 7: Responsive Design Integration

**User Story:** As a player on different screen sizes, I want the background to adapt properly, so that the experience works on all devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the container resizes THEN the system SHALL recalculate emoticon positions and boundaries
2. WHEN emoticons respawn THEN the system SHALL use current container dimensions
3. WHEN positioning elements THEN the system SHALL account for viewport changes
4. IF the container is not available THEN the system SHALL wait for mounting before initialization
5. WHEN orientation changes THEN the system SHALL adapt animation parameters

### Requirement 8: Accessibility and Visual Comfort

**User Story:** As a player with visual sensitivities, I want animations that don't cause discomfort, so that I can enjoy the game safely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN animations run THEN the system SHALL use reasonable motion intensities
2. WHEN opacity changes THEN the system SHALL avoid sudden flashes or strobes
3. WHEN colors change THEN the system SHALL maintain sufficient contrast
4. IF reduced motion is preferred THEN the system SHALL respect accessibility settings
5. WHEN text shadows are applied THEN the system SHALL ensure readability

### Requirement 9: Weighted Random Selection

**User Story:** As a game designer, I want control over emoticon frequency, so that I can balance the visual experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN selecting emoticons THEN the system SHALL use weighted random selection based on defined weights
2. WHEN weights are not specified THEN the system SHALL default to equal probability
3. WHEN calculating totals THEN the system SHALL sum weights correctly for probability distribution
4. IF no emoticons are available THEN the system SHALL provide fallback options
5. WHEN morphing targets THEN the system SHALL respect the same weighting system

### Requirement 10: State Management Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the background to integrate seamlessly with game state, so that visual feedback is always synchronized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN game props change THEN the system SHALL update visual state immediately
2. WHEN percentage changes THEN the system SHALL recalculate reaction intensity
3. WHEN contrarian mode toggles THEN the system SHALL adjust tier selection logic
4. IF showResults is true THEN the system SHALL adapt visual behavior accordingly
5. WHEN isActive changes THEN the system SHALL toggle animation and visibility states
