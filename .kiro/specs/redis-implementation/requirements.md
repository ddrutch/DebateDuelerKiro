# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a comprehensive Redis-based storage system for a Reddit-based debate game application. The system is being submitted to the Kiro hackathon and represents a fully functional implementation that demonstrates advanced Redis usage patterns, real-time data management, and scalable game state persistence. The project showcases how Redis can be effectively utilized in a modern web application to handle complex gaming scenarios with multiple concurrent users.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Redis Data Storage Architecture

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want a robust Redis-based storage system that can handle complex game data structures, so that I can ensure data persistence and scalability for my debate game application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system initializes THEN Redis SHALL be configured with proper connection settings and error handling
2. WHEN storing game data THEN the system SHALL use structured Redis keys with consistent naming patterns (e.g., `game:{postId}:player:{userId}`)
3. WHEN accessing data THEN the system SHALL implement proper serialization/deserialization for complex JavaScript objects
4. IF Redis connection fails THEN the system SHALL provide graceful error handling and logging
5. WHEN storing deck data THEN the system SHALL maintain referential integrity between questions, cards, and statistics

### Requirement 2: Player Session Management

**User Story:** As a player, I want my game progress to be automatically saved and restored, so that I can continue playing even if my session is interrupted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a player starts a game THEN the system SHALL create a unique player session with scoring mode, answers, and progress tracking
2. WHEN a player submits an answer THEN the system SHALL update the session state in Redis immediately
3. WHEN a player reconnects THEN the system SHALL restore their exact game state from Redis
4. IF a player completes a game THEN the system SHALL mark the session as 'finished' and preserve final scores
5. WHEN multiple players play simultaneously THEN each session SHALL be isolated and independently managed

### Requirement 3: Real-time Statistics and Leaderboard System

**User Story:** As a game administrator, I want real-time statistics tracking and leaderboard functionality, so that I can provide engaging competitive features and analyze player behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a player submits an answer THEN the system SHALL update question statistics in real-time
2. WHEN a game is completed THEN the system SHALL automatically update the leaderboard using Redis sorted sets
3. WHEN displaying leaderboards THEN the system SHALL show top 10 players with accurate rankings
4. IF a player already exists on the leaderboard THEN the system SHALL prevent duplicate entries
5. WHEN calculating statistics THEN the system SHALL track both individual card selections and position-based data for sequence questions

### Requirement 4: Dynamic Content Management

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to dynamically add, edit, and delete questions in game decks, so that I can maintain fresh and engaging content without system downtime.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding a new question THEN the system SHALL store it in Redis with proper metadata and initialize statistics
2. WHEN editing a question THEN the system SHALL update the Redis data and maintain data consistency
3. WHEN deleting a question THEN the system SHALL remove both the question and associated statistics
4. IF a user lacks permissions THEN the system SHALL prevent unauthorized content modifications
5. WHEN content changes occur THEN the system SHALL immediately reflect updates to all connected clients

### Requirement 5: Advanced Scoring Algorithm Integration

**User Story:** As a player, I want sophisticated scoring mechanisms that account for answer popularity, time remaining, and question types, so that the game provides fair and engaging competition.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calculating scores THEN the system SHALL support multiple scoring modes (contrarian, conformist, trivia)
2. WHEN processing sequence questions THEN the system SHALL track position-specific statistics for accurate scoring
3. WHEN applying time bonuses THEN the system SHALL factor remaining time into the final score calculation
4. IF question type is trivia THEN the system SHALL award points based on correctness rather than popularity
5. WHEN updating statistics THEN the system SHALL maintain both card-level and position-level data for comprehensive analytics

### Requirement 6: Scalable Redis Key Management

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want a well-organized Redis key structure that supports efficient queries and data management, so that the system can scale to handle thousands of concurrent games.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating Redis keys THEN the system SHALL use hierarchical naming conventions for easy management
2. WHEN storing different data types THEN the system SHALL use appropriate Redis data structures (strings, sorted sets, hashes)
3. WHEN querying data THEN the system SHALL minimize Redis operations through efficient key design
4. IF data needs to be cleaned up THEN the system SHALL support bulk operations on related keys
5. WHEN scaling the application THEN the Redis key structure SHALL support horizontal scaling patterns

### Requirement 7: Error Handling and Data Integrity

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want robust error handling and data validation, so that the system maintains data integrity even under adverse conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Redis operations fail THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information and attempt recovery
2. WHEN data corruption is detected THEN the system SHALL prevent invalid data from being stored
3. WHEN concurrent access occurs THEN the system SHALL handle race conditions gracefully
4. IF network issues arise THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic with exponential backoff
5. WHEN validating data THEN the system SHALL ensure all required fields are present before Redis storage

### Requirement 8: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As an end user, I want fast response times and smooth gameplay, so that the gaming experience remains engaging and responsive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing frequently used data THEN the system SHALL optimize Redis queries for minimal latency
2. WHEN updating statistics THEN the system SHALL batch operations where possible to reduce Redis calls
3. WHEN loading game data THEN the system SHALL implement efficient data retrieval patterns
4. IF memory usage becomes high THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate data expiration policies
5. WHEN handling concurrent users THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent performance under load
