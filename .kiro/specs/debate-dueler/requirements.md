# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a comprehensive game orchestrator system for a Reddit-based debate game application. The DebateDueler component serves as the main controller that manages the entire game lifecycle, from initialization through completion, including state management, session persistence, scoring calculations, and user interface coordination. The system is being submitted to the Kiro hackathon and represents a fully functional implementation that demonstrates advanced React state management, real-time user experience, and seamless backend integration.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Game State Management

**User Story:** As a player, I want the game to maintain my progress and navigate smoothly between different phases, so that I can have a consistent and intuitive gaming experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application initializes THEN the system SHALL manage four distinct game phases (welcome, playing, results, admin)
2. WHEN transitioning between phases THEN the system SHALL update the UI components accordingly
3. WHEN the game state changes THEN the system SHALL persist critical data to prevent loss
4. IF an invalid phase transition occurs THEN the system SHALL handle it gracefully
5. WHEN the component unmounts THEN the system SHALL clean up any active timers or subscriptions

### Requirement 2: Session Persistence and Recovery

**User Story:** As a player, I want my game progress to be automatically saved and restored, so that I can continue playing even if my browser session is interrupted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a game session exists THEN the system SHALL store session data in localStorage
2. WHEN the application reloads THEN the system SHALL attempt to restore the previous session
3. WHEN session restoration succeeds THEN the system SHALL resume at the correct game phase
4. WHEN session data is corrupted THEN the system SHALL safely discard it and start fresh
5. WHEN a game completes THEN the system SHALL clear the stored session data

### Requirement 3: Backend Communication System

**User Story:** As a game system, I want reliable communication with the backend services, so that game data and user actions are properly synchronized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the component mounts THEN the system SHALL send an initialization request to the backend
2. WHEN receiving initialization data THEN the system SHALL validate and process the response
3. WHEN backend communication fails THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages
4. WHEN data refresh is needed THEN the system SHALL request updated information from the server
5. WHEN sending game results THEN the system SHALL include all necessary session and answer data

### Requirement 4: Scoring Algorithm Integration

**User Story:** As a player, I want accurate and fair scoring based on my answers and the chosen scoring mode, so that the game provides meaningful feedback on my performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calculating scores THEN the system SHALL support three scoring modes (contrarian, conformist, trivia)
2. WHEN processing multiple-choice questions THEN the system SHALL handle correct/incorrect answers
3. WHEN processing sequence questions THEN the system SHALL evaluate position-based accuracy
4. WHEN applying time bonuses THEN the system SHALL factor remaining time into final scores
5. WHEN updating local scores THEN the system SHALL maintain running totals throughout the game

### Requirement 5: Answer Processing and Validation

**User Story:** As a player, I want my answers to be processed reliably and provide immediate feedback, so that I can understand the impact of my choices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN submitting an answer THEN the system SHALL validate the answer format and content
2. WHEN processing answers locally THEN the system SHALL calculate scores without backend calls during gameplay
3. WHEN a question is completed THEN the system SHALL advance to the next question or end the game
4. WHEN the game completes THEN the system SHALL send all answers and final score to the backend
5. WHEN answer processing fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error feedback to the user

### Requirement 6: Game Initialization and Setup

**User Story:** As a player starting a new game, I want a smooth setup process that configures everything correctly, so that I can begin playing immediately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting a new game THEN the system SHALL create a new player session with selected scoring mode
2. WHEN initializing a session THEN the system SHALL set appropriate default values and timestamps
3. WHEN clearing previous data THEN the system SHALL remove old localStorage entries and timers
4. WHEN session creation fails THEN the system SHALL display helpful error messages
5. WHEN resuming an existing session THEN the system SHALL restore answers and progress accurately

### Requirement 7: Error Handling and User Feedback

**User Story:** As a player encountering issues, I want clear feedback and recovery options, so that I can continue using the application effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN network errors occur THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages
2. WHEN data loading fails THEN the system SHALL provide retry options or refresh suggestions
3. WHEN invalid data is received THEN the system SHALL handle it gracefully without crashing
4. WHEN the user needs to reload THEN the system SHALL provide clear instructions
5. WHEN errors are resolved THEN the system SHALL return to normal operation seamlessly

### Requirement 8: Admin Functionality Integration

**User Story:** As an administrator or content creator, I want access to management features when appropriate, so that I can maintain and modify game content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN admin permissions are detected THEN the system SHALL enable admin navigation options
2. WHEN entering admin mode THEN the system SHALL preserve current game state for return
3. WHEN returning from admin THEN the system SHALL refresh data and update the interface
4. WHEN permission checks fail THEN the system SHALL restrict access appropriately
5. WHEN admin actions complete THEN the system SHALL provide feedback and update relevant data

### Requirement 9: Performance and Responsiveness

**User Story:** As a player on various devices and network conditions, I want the game to remain responsive and performant, so that I can enjoy a smooth gaming experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing user interactions THEN the system SHALL respond within acceptable time limits
2. WHEN loading states occur THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback to the user
3. WHEN local calculations happen THEN the system SHALL not block the UI thread
4. WHEN memory usage increases THEN the system SHALL clean up unused resources
5. WHEN the component unmounts THEN the system SHALL cancel all pending operations

### Requirement 10: Data Synchronization and Consistency

**User Story:** As a player with an existing session, I want my local and server data to stay synchronized, so that my progress is always accurate and up-to-date.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN local answers change THEN the system SHALL maintain consistency with session state
2. WHEN server data updates THEN the system SHALL merge changes appropriately
3. WHEN conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL resolve them in favor of user progress
4. WHEN refreshing data THEN the system SHALL update all dependent components
5. WHEN final submission occurs THEN the system SHALL ensure all data is current and complete
