**Project Name:** Reddit Debate Dueler

**Summary:**
A Reddit-integrated game where users face off against an AI "Redditor" NPC in a timed series of debate rounds. Each round involves choosing from themed card options (e.g. strongest animal, ethical questions, trivia, next-step decisions), reacting under time pressure, and earning a score. At the end, users are ranked on a leaderboard and encouraged to remix the game with their own card sets.

**Goals:**

* Create a lightweight, humorous, and interactive card-based game on Reddit using Devvit and Bolt.
* Encourage community interaction through remixable game posts.
* Track scores and provide competitive/replayable value.

3. **Mini-Challenges**: Bonus rounds with Yes/No ethics, math, or logic questions.
4. **Next-Step Progression Rounds**: Choose what to do next in a fictional scenario.
